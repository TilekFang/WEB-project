This is the landing page for the sale of geek watches, deautner watch.
This website was created completely independently and may not meet some of the criteria for the midterm exam. 
The website uses HTML, HR AND BOOTSTRAP.
I tried to make an advertisement but I didn't have enough time, so there is only one. Also, the buttons are working, do not perform any action, since I wanted to link to another page.
Also you can rate on the website at this link:
